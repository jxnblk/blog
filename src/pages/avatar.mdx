My avatar originated in 2010, while I was working as a designer at Opower.
Each person on the design team illustrated a self-portrait that we would use to create a combined team portrait.
In the [original version](https://dribbble.com/shots/19382-Jackson-a-opossum), I was holding a opossum playing dead.
The opossum was sort of an unofficial mascot that we'd made up, and well, I'm originally from West Virginia.

The avatar has seen a few revisions over time, and the current version is almost completely hand-coded and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jxnblk/avatar).

## Variations

Over the years, I've made a few variations for special occassions.
