	- Hackathon
	- Siloed teams & separate apps
	- "Common Components"
	- No open source
	- React, styled components, npm
	- Catering to Developer problems
	- GitHub: Open Source from the start
	- Shared ownership

	- Prototyping tools
- Future tooling
	- Written language and math are incredible tools
	- We teach children fractions
	- But don't expect them to become PHDs
	- Bicycle of the mind
	- Code is how you ride the bike
	- Code is about layers of abstraction
	- Abstractions on top of HTML, CSS, & JavaScript
	- Current tooling has not kept up with front end development
	- Browser inspector is too low level
	- React, ES6, Graphql

Styled System

- SC and other CSS-in-JS
- Components as an abstraction on top of CSS
- Can still drop back into low-level CSS when needed
- Consumers of the components don't need to think about CSS implementation
- Dynamic/functional styles
- Authoring with s2
- Consuming s2 components

Cheap UI
- iron triangle
- Good cheap fast
- Mythical man-month brooks law

Pretty sure that LinkNYC is some sort of self-replicating, ancient alien artificial intelligence

Developer tooling for design systems

- Developer first
- DRY
- React + styled components
	- Isolated styles
	- no clashing
	- Overrides happen in separate apps
- Storybook
- npm
- Siloed teams
- Shared components
- Separate UI
- Dev velocity
- Cheap UI
	- Expensive UI
	- ROI
- Redline specs
- QA cycles
- Feel the pain before you want the bandaid
- Open Source
- Consumed but didn't contribute
- Open source from the start
- GitHub
- PRs and issues
- Great professional experience for developers

- don't enforce it
- Make it so good people want to use it
- Make it so that teams can make it work for them
- "Make it go viral"

- Styled system
- By the time the designers asked for it, we already had it in place

<!--
- Next
	- Docs site
	- Chromatic
	- Sketchapp html
	- Compositor

What makes React hard?
- today's web is built on a layer of abstraction where design tools have not kept up
- Browser inspectors and debuggers are too low level

- typical approach: design driven
- Dev was mentally ready before design team
- Catering to Developer needs
- Iâ€™ve seen DS efforts struggle because a lack of understanding on the dev side
- DRY principle
- No one wants to write CSS
- Faster dev velocity
- "Cheap UI"
- Devs hate redline specs and extra QA cycles
- Right mix of tools
	- react, sc, npm, storybook, graphql
- shared components
- Refinement of an idea
- Bootstrap, Base css, Rebass, css in js, styled components, styled system

- Siloed teams
- Encourage everyone to contribute

Collaboration tools
- github (issues, PRs, pages)
- storybook
- No one wants redline specs
	- feel the pain before wanting a solution
- Slack

- components
- React components
- Composition
- Functional composition
- HN quotes
- Atomic design slide

- theming
- Interchangeable
- Components
- Interchangeable Components
- Components as configuration

- Standard Components

I love tooling. I love talking about tooling.
So much so that I was once called a tool.
