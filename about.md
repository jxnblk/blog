Since 2020, Jackson has been teaching himself game development with Unity and is working on [Novantica][],
a sci-fi adventure game, set in a futuristic urban open world where time travel is common,
god-like AI govern the world, and a mysterious event has disrupted the city.
You can [wishlist Novantica on Steam][novantica-steam].

Jackson has worked on several open source projects that helped defined modern approaches to styling front end applications.
Starting in 2013, he worked with Adam Morse and John Otander on [CSS Stats][], a web application to statically analyze a URLs CSS.
In 2015, he created [Basscss][], the first atomic/utility-based CSS framework that helped popularize using multiple classnames
on a single element to style HTML.
Basscss used a small set of theme values for font-size, color palettes, margin and padding scales, and more,
which is now common practice in front end design systems.
If you've seen (or cursed at) code that looks like \`class="block mb2 blue"\`, then you've seen his work.
In 2017, he released v1 of [Rebass][] (his first time on [Hacker News][rebass-hn]),
a library of stateless functional React components with styling, which help introduce the concept of styled UI components in React.
Extracting the utility style props from Rebass, he created [Styled System][] in 2017.
In 2019, he released [Theme UI][], an extension of these ideas that provided utilities for dark mode, styling content in MDX,
and a universal \`sx\` prop to style elements inline with theme-based values.


Jackson has also worked on various other open source projects.
He created [MDX Deck][] as a simple way to make slide presentations with MDX.
Helped John Otander with the conceptual design and syntax of [MDX][], a combination of markdown and JSX.
Created several color tools, including [Colorable][] for testing color contrast, Palx, [Spectral][], and [Hello Color][].
SVG-related tools, including [Loading][], [Geomicons][], Microicon, [Paths][], and [Reline][].

Jackson also produces electronic music, previously running a project called [Microbeats][], in which each track was created in one hour or less.
He is one-half of [MrsJxn][], a collaboration with Adam Morse.
He's also dabbled with interactive music apps like [Skullcat][].

Jackson currently works as a design engineer at [Val Town][].
Previously, he worked at Gatsby JS, Priceline, The Grid, Etsy, Kickstarter, Stitch Fix, Living Social, and Opower.
He studied sociology, Japanese language, and graphic design at Marshall University.
