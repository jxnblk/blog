As you walked through the city, you'd inevitably encounter the same model over and over again.\nI could explain it away in the game by saying that the story involves time travel, but I wanted more random variety of the NPCs populating the city.\nThe best way I could think of achieving this was by modularizing the characters so that I could randomly generate any number of NPCs using primitive parts and different color palettes.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img\n    src='/images/modular-npcs/main-characters-before-after.jpg'\n    alt='Screenshot of the main characters, before and after'\n  />\n  <figcaption>\n    Main characters, before and after\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I started with rebuilding the core characters in Blender to try to nail down an approach and style that fit better with the feel of the game.\nOnce I was happy with the general look and feel, I started building out modular characters based on this style.\nStarting with a base body type, I added multiple different models for hair styles, tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories like sunglasses and hats.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img\n    src='/images/modular-npcs/blender-parts.jpg'\n    alt='Screenshot of the model in Blender'\n  />\n  <figcaption>\n    The first body type with all modular parts shown and an example of only showing one set of the modular parts\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>For coloring the models, I created several new textures that are UV mapped based on skin, hair, and colors for the tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories.\nThis way I could swap the texture on the model to change the complexion and colors of the outfits independent from the parts.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img\n    src='/images/modular-npcs/textures.jpg'\n    alt='Screenshot of the model in Blender'\n  />\n  <figcaption>\n    Some of the textures used to color the modular characters\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Once I had a decent number of parts, I exported all the parts together as a single FBX file, which I uploaded to Mixamo to rig for the game.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img\n    src='/images/modular-npcs/mixamo-rigging.jpg'\n    alt='Screenshot of rigging the character in Mixamo'\n  />\n  <figcaption>\n    Rigging the model with all modular parts together\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I brought the rigged model into Unity and created a material for the new textures.\nIn Unity, each modular part is a separate game object within the model, and I wrote a script to randomize the different part shown for each section of the model, i.e. hair, top, bottom, shoes, and accessory.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img\n    src='/images/modular-npcs/game-objects.jpg'\n    alt='Screenshot of the models hierarchy in Unity'\n  />\n  <figcaption>\n    The modular parts are all separate game objects in Unity\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n  <img\n    src='/images/modular-npcs/unity-scripts.jpg'\n    alt='Screenshot of the modular character scripts inspectors'\n  />\n  <figcaption>\n    The Unity script allows for an array of named sections, each with an array of possible parts to render\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The <code>ModularCharacter</code> script randomizes which part to show for each section, and the <code>ModularColors</code> script randomizes which texture to use for the whole model.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/jxnblk/3e21f2494863b4e13a79c783bb05f248.js\"></script>\n<p>Although I ended up not using it, I also had an array of rules to ensure that specific tops would always match their bottoms for things like aprons and suits.</p>\n<p>By randomizing the parts of each section along with the colors used in the textures and the scale of the model, this gave me a huge variety of different possibilities for each NPC's prefab instance.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Modular NPC extras – WIP <a href=\"https://t.co/Oo70RK4w8d\">pic.twitter.com/Oo70RK4w8d</a></p>&mdash;
