If, for example, conversion never gets above 3.9%, and you spend 2 weeks designing and redesigning a button, there are probably some other variables affecting things, and there are better ways to prioritize your time.</p>\n<p>But taking this idea as an approach to problem solving, gauging the efficacy of a design solution, and setting up goals for a product, I think it’s a concept worth exploring.</p>\n"}
