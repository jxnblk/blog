Styled System is meant to be just one such abstraction.</p>\n<h2>Consistency</h2>\n<p>Consistency is the bedrock of any constraint-based design or design system effort.\nIt goes hand-in-hand with software development principles like <em>Don't Repeat Yourself</em> (DRY)\nand the general idea of abstraction.\nWith modern tooling like CSS-in-JS it's never been easier to ensure that values are type safe and that styles are consistent to a certain degree.</p>\n<p>Styled System takes advantage of some of these capabilities and attempts to help teams bake this consistency in by default.\nA hard-coded font size or color value in a code review is easy to smell,\nand developers naturally opt-in to keeping values stored in a globally shared theme object.</p>\n<h2>Responding to Change</h2>\n<p>Consistency is great, but I've never seen a product freeze feature development to devote effort into keeping things looking consistent.\nDevelopers are frequently working in short sprint cycles to finish tasks that likely didn't account for styling consistency when they were estimated.\nOver time this leads to technical debt and parts of the CSS code base quickly become obsolete pieces of legacy code.</p>\n<p>Styled System tries to balance the consistency provided by the core theme object with the reality that developers will constantly need to make one-off changes to ship features.\nBy putting <em>some</em> of the styling control into a component's props,\ndevelopers can keep these one-off changes isolated to the parts of the code base where they are used.\nIf a message component <em>really</em> needs to have a 13px font size, you can put that magic number directly in the component that needs it, and when that component is deleted, the magic number is gone as well.</p>\n<h2>Mobile-First</h2>\n<p>While Responsive Web Design[^4] is nearly a decade old, and we've been designing for mobile devices for some time now, there still aren't clear best practices for how developers should approach these design concepts.\nStyled System includes an opinionated syntax for how to style things responsively that's meant to\nhelp shape the way people think about designing for mobile devices.\nInstead of burying conditionals for a single CSS property across multiple media query blocks,\nStyled System uses an <a href=\"https://styled-system.com/responsive-styles\">array syntax</a> to force developers into thinking how a singular dimension, such as font size or width, should change from one breakpoint to the next.\nThis syntax is probably the most contentious part of Styled System, and I've been pleasantly surprised at how quickly I've seen people pick this up and how popular it's become.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">/* example in CSS */\n.thing {\n  font-size: 16px;\n  width: 100%;\n}\n@media screen and (min-width: 40em) {\n  font-size: 20px;\n  width: 50%;\n}\n@media screen and (min-width: 52em) {\n  font-size: 24px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">// example with Styled System\n&#x3C;Thing\n  fontSize={[ 16, 20, 24 ]}\n  width={[1, 1/2]}\n/>\n</code></pre>\n<p>A year and a half later,\nStyled System has turned out to be far more well received than I ever would have expected,\nand I've learned a tremendous amount from seeing how other people have taken the core concepts within it in different directions.\nIt may not be a good fit for every team out there, but I hope to see more explorations\ninto how we can build more powerful abstractions on top of CSS to keep pushing the Web platform forward.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A lot of the ideas within Styled System come from the people I've learned from over the years.\nThanks to:\nNicole Sullivan, Nicolas Gallagher, Jonathan Snook, Adam Morse, John Otander, Diana Mounter,\nJon Gold, Anh-Thư Huỳnh, Alex Mykyta, John Polacek,\nand all the <a href=\"https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system/graphs/contributors\">Styled System contributors</a> and users.</p>\n<p>[^1]: I find some things difficult to put into words, especially when it's a newer idea, and think that, just like a picture is worth a thousand words, showing code can be a much more powerful way to express an idea in some cases.\nSee also: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don%27t_tell\">Show, don't tell</a>\n[^2]: I plan to expand on this in another post - see also <a href=\"https://github.com/basscss/basscss/\">Basscss</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jxnblk/reflexbox\">Reflexbox</a>, <a href=\"https://rebassjs.org\">Rebass</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jxnblk/axs/tree/v1.0.0\">Axs</a>\n[^3]: <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/brada/2003/10/02/the-pit-of-success/\">The Pit of Success</a>\n[^4]: <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design\">Responsive Web Design</a></p>\n"}
