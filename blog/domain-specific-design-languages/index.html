<p>definition of DSL</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A domain-specific language (DSL) is a computer language specialized to a particular application domain. This is in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language
A domain-specific language is created specifically to solve problems in a particular domain and is not intended to be able to solve problems outside it (although that may be technically possible). In contrast, general-purpose languages are created to solve problems in many domains.</p>

<p>consider designing in iOS, it requires domain-specific (i.e. platform-specific) design conventions and patterns, predominantly outlined in Apple's HIG</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Deviating from the HIG means you are creating a new design language specific to your application,
which may have its benefits, but also requires more learning on the part of the user.</p>
<p>Similarly, deviating from a web application's style guide, UI component library, or interaction pattern library
is equivalent to creating a new design language that users need to learn.</p>
<p>The web itself has it's own design language.
Users have acclimated to using blue underlined links, scrolling through pages, using standard form elements,
as well as a plethora of other interaction design patterns.</p>
<p>Though sometimes DSLs are appropriate,
the main disadvantage to using a DSL is that it requires domain-specifig knowledge of certain APIs rather than relying on more standard conventions. An example of this would be using coffeescript or JSX, rather than the standardized JavaScript (EMCAScript) syntax</p>
