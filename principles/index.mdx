# Good web design is

## Universally Accessible

Everyone should be able to view and use the web. Donâ€™t exclude people by making bad decisions.

## Simple

Keep it simple stupid. The mother of all design principles still applies to the web.

## Familiar

The web is built on patterns. Rely on familiarity and avoid breaking expectations.

## Tested

Data is a powerful tool, but just like any tool, it can be abused. Gather and utilize qualitative and quantitative data and constantly strive to improve processes.

## Iterative

The web is an ever-evolving platform, and web design is never finished.

## Unobtrusive

The web is about information. Make it easy to find and stay out of the way.

## Fast

The web thrives on the speed of information. Make things faster not slower.

## As little design as possible

And as little code as possible.
